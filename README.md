# CloudFormation Resource Provider Go

This module will let you create lambdas that can be used as CloudFormation Resources.

It is very much a fork of the official [CloudFormation CLI Go Plugin](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-go-plugin). However, this one supports V2 of the SDK, and supports Go Generics.
